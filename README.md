# Dungeon Crawl

Dungeon crawl is a small terminal game where the player must survive a 
dungeon full of monsters and traps. The player wakes up in a room and must
walk through other rooms. The game ends when the player finds the exit.

In each chamber, the player must decide what to do. The result of these
decisions can lead the player to treasure, traps, enemies, more rooms to 
explore, or exit.

- The game starts with the player choosing a hery to play as.
- The hero has hit points, which are reduced by talking damage from fight
enemies or falling into traps.
- When the character reaches zero hit points, the player loses the game.
- The character's hit points can be restored by finding healing potions or
resting in safe rooms.
- The challenge is to find the exit room before the hero reaches zero hit
points.
